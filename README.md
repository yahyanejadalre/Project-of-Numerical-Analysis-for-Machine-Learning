# Project of Numerical Analysis for Machine Learning
## Project Overview
This repository includes a detailed report and a presentation based on the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.09586.pdf"><strong>–Understanding LSTM – a tutorial into Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks</strong></a>. This project aims to provide readers with an understanding of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and the reasons for their status as one of the most potent dynamic classifiers.
## Contents
*  **Report**: A comprehensive document that explains the concepts, methodologies, and applications of LSTM networks.
*  **Presentation**: A summarized version of the report, designed for quick consumption and presentation purposes.
